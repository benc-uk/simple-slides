# Simple Slides
Simple HTML based slide presenter, designed for demos and other situations where switching to PowerPoint is distracting or unnecessary.

## Usage
1) Export your presentation as PNG from PowerPoint, using *File --> Save As*. When prompted select **All Slides**
2) PowerPoint will put all of the PNG files into a subdirectory 
3) Download [release of this repo](https://github.com/benc-uk/simple-slides/releases), extract & copy *slides.html* into the directory alongside the PNG files
4) Open *slides.html* in your browser

## Note
The *slide.html* file is expecting the PNGs for each slide to be named; Slide1.png, Slide2.png, Slide3.png etc. This is how PowerPoint names them by default.

## Tip
To improve the resolution and & quality of the PNG files follow [this Microsoft support article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827745/how-to-change-the-export-resolution-of-a-powerpoint-slide) which lets you specifiy a higher DPI (e.g. 200) for exported images
